# Image Matching using RANSAC and Quantized Projection Function of SIFT vector
Estimates Homography between images using RANSAC with SIFT features.
Determines matching correspondences between images and generates visualization of matches.

Generates summary SIFT features using Quantized Projective Function to improve running time.

## Running the tests
./a2 part image_1 image_2 ... image_n
